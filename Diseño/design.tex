\section{Introduction}



\subsection{Purpose}
The primary purpose of this document is to present a description of the design elements
of an ASIP in a general approximate application. 



\subsection{Scope}
This research concerns the selection and optimization of error-tolerant applications. For 
this, ASIP configurations using specific approximate instructions for the selected 
applications are to be delivered. Furthermore, each ASIP configuration will be described by 
a set of parameters that the final system will possess, such as energy efficiency, area, 
execution time, and output error. This project is expected to help approximate computing 
to be a more widespread tendency and generate a strong base knowledge for future 
projects where there is freedom to choose the parameters of hardware running a 
certain type of application in terms of resource consumption and accepted error.

% Entities: Actors, stakeholders, case uses

% Relationships: Output and input between actors and design

% constraints: QoS, form and medium of interaction
\subsection{Context}

Since approximated computing is still in its infancy, a lot of research and testing is still needed, 
so the users of the developed ASIPs are the same research groups behind this
project. \\

Figure \ref{fig:cont} shows the general scheme for an approximate possible application.

\end{figure}


As shown in figure \ref{fig:cont}, the approximate application is expected to have a pipeline structure, where one of its stages or sections (in that case
the n-th stage) can be approximate. The purpose of the ASIP configuration is to provide the user flexibility between
the original version of an application and the optimized one, allowing for a customized
balance between resource consumption and output error. The approximate section needs to perform the original action but with less resource consumption, and
still allowing for a acceptable output error, considering that a quality change in a specific section can have a big impact on other sections
that depend of it.

% Composition and modular assembly of
% systems in terms of subsystems and
% (pluggable) components, buy vs. build,
% reuse of components

% Entities: types of constituents of a system: subsystems, components, modules; ports and (provided
% and required) interfaces; also libraries, frameworks, software repositories, catalogs, and templates.

% Relationships: composition, use, and generalization

% Attributes: identification, type, purpose, function, and definition attribute should be utilized.
\section{Composition}

The ASIP configurations that will be developed are expected to impact on the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
and the processor components. For example, an assembly instruction may be created to be equivalent of two
other assembly instructions, with added hardware but less execution time, given that such operation is very frequent
on the high level program. Figure \ref{fig:comp} shows a general scheme for the interaction between these layers.

\section{Structure}
The hardware structure of the generated ASIPs will consist of the usual components for a pipeline

and reduced generic hardware (e.g ALU may only have needed operations).

% at what level actions occur.
\section{Interaction}
The interaction between the hardware components will follow a general pipeline scheme.


% System dynamics including modes, states, transitions, and reactions to events.
