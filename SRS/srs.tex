\section{Introduction}


% Delineate the purpose of the software to be specified.
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the design of Application-Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs) for 
error-tolerant applications. The ASIPs are meant to execute with improved performance (for instance, 
energy consumption or execution time would be lower) compared to a General Purpose Proccesor (GPP) but
also have greater flexibility than ASICs.

% Describe the scope of the software under consideration by
% a) Identifying the software product(s) to be produced by name (e.g., Host DBMS, Report Generator, etc.);
% b) Explaining what the software product(s) will do;
% c) Describing the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and
% goals;
% d) Being consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., the system requirements
% specification), if they exist.
\subsection{Scope}
This research concerns both application selection and application optmization. For this, ASIP configurations using specific approximated instructions for the 
 selected applications are to be delivered. Furthermore, each ASIP configuration will be described
 by a set of parameters that the final system will possess, such as energy efficiency, area, execution time, and output error.
 This project is expected to help make approximated computing a more widespread tendency and generate a strong base knowledge for future projects
 where there is freedom to choose the parameters of the hardware running a certain type of an application in terms of resource consumption and accepted error. 




\subsection{Product overview}


% Define the system's relationship to other related products.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, then relate the requirements of that larger system to the
% functionality of the product covered by the SRS.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, then identify the interfaces between the product covered by the
% SRS and the larger system of which the product is an element.
% A block diagram showing the major elements of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces
% can be helpful.
% Describe how the software operates within the following constraints:
% a) System interfaces;
% b) User interfaces;
% c) Hardware interfaces;
% d) Software interfaces;
\subsubsection{Product perspective}
The generated result will consist of studied and selected applications where one of its sections or just an instruction
is replaced by an approximated version, to improve execution time, area, or power consumption while
maintaining an acceptable error threshold. This research is a stand-alone project in the sense that the ASIP configurations
made will be specific to a selected application and will not operate with other interfaces. This means that the configurations
developed will only be constrained by each specific application's inherent constraints or limitations, for example, which section is error-tolerant or
which parameter is the most critical. 




% Provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an
% accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and
% invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
% Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section of the
% higher-level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software product.
% Note that for the sake of clarity
% a) The product functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the
% acquirer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.
% b) Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships. Such a
% diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among
% variables.
\subsubsection{Product functions}
With the research on ASIPs, the approximate computing paradigm will be expanded, which will 
enable more personalized applications to balance flexibility and performance to have a 
good trade-off between those variables.

The ASIPs that will be integrated to an specific application will have the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Adjustable error threshold: The error threshold can vary according to a specific ASIP configuration.
 
 \item Adjustable resource consumption: The resource consumption can vary according to a specific ASIP configuration.
 
 \item Scalable: Regardless of the amount of hardware used, the ASIP parameters are expected to remain roughly the
 same.
\end{itemize}



% Describe those general characteristics of the intended groups of users of the product including characteristics
% that may influence usability, such as educational level, experience, disabilities, and technical expertise. This
% description should not state specific requirements, but rather should state the reasons why certain specific
% requirements are later specified in specific requirements in subclause 9.5.9.
\subsubsection{User characteristics}
Since approximated computing is still in its infancy, a lot of research and testing is still needed, 
so the users of the developed ASIPs are the same research groups of which this 
project is a part of. The research group members possess, in general, these characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Technical knowledge: It is expected that users have an in-depth knowledge of the specific application
 that is being optimized, as well as a fair amount of knowledge of hardware architecture design. 
 
 \item Access to specialized tools: Users are expected to have a set of tools that allow them to synthetize
 and simulate a hardware architecture, as well as a hardware board to implement a desired design. 
\end{itemize}



% Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the supplier's options, including
% a) Regulatory policies;
% b) Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
% c) Interfaces to other applications;
% d) Parallel operation;
% e) Audit functions;
% f) Control functions;
% g) Higher-order language requirements;
% h) Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
% i) Quality requirements (e.g., reliability)
% j) Criticality of the application;
% k) Safety and security considerations.
% l) Physical/mental considerations
\subsubsection{Limitations}
The following limitations are considered for the ASIPs developed:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Performance gain: The gain in any of the four parameters (energy efficiency, area, execution time and output error) can never be
 greater than the theoretical possible gain given by the Amdahl equation, which is determined by the percentage of the application
 that is being optimized. 
 
 \item Development time: The 16 weeks of the institutional calendar of the ITCR limit the scope of the project to the configurations that can
 be developed in such a short amount of time.
\end{itemize}

The resources needed for the project (e.g hardware platform) are not considered as limitations since they are already given by the research group
and the academic institutions.

% a) Name of item;
% b) Description of purpose;
% c) Source of input or destination of output;
% d) Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance;
% e) Units of measure;
% f) Timing;
% g) Relationships to other inputs/outputs;
% h) Screen formats/organization;
% i) Window formats/organization;
% j) Data formats;

% amount of data to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions.
% The performance requirements should be stated in measurable terms.
% For example,
% 95 % of the transactions shall be processed in less than 1 second.
% rather than,
% An operator shall not have to wait for the transaction to complete.

% limitations.
\subsection{Design constraints}
Design contraints are understood as aspects which are fixed for the project. Since this is a research project, minimun design contraints are presented:

% List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design
% constraints on the software but any changes to these factors can affect the requirements in the SRS. For
% example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated
% for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change
% accordingly.
\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
This project is based on the assumption that, given research and articles in the area of approximate computation,
it is feasible to introduce functions or approximate blocks in a given application in order to introduce error and
at the same time have an improvement in resources consumption, so that both variables can be manipulated.
