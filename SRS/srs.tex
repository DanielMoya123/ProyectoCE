\section{Introduction}


% Delineate the purpose of the software to be specified.
\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this research is to explore the design of Application-Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs) for 
error-tolerant applications. The ASIPs are meant to execute with improved performance (for instance, 
energy consumption or execution time would be lower) compared to a General Purpose Proccesor (GPP) but
also have a greater flexibility than ASICs.

% Describe the scope of the software under consideration by
% a) Identifying the software product(s) to be produced by name (e.g., Host DBMS, Report Generator, etc.);
% b) Explaining what the software product(s) will do;
% c) Describing the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and
% goals;
% d) Being consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., the system requirements
% specification), if they exist.
\subsection{Scope}

This research concerns both application selection and application optmization. For this, ASIP configurations using specific approximated instructions for the 
 selected applications are expected to be delivered.
 
This project is expected to help make approximated computing a more solid tendency.


This research is not merely concerned about

This research is restricted to


\subsection{Product overview}


% Define the system's relationship to other related products.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, then relate the requirements of that larger system to the
% functionality of the product covered by the SRS.
% If the product is an element of a larger system, then identify the interfaces between the product covered by the
% SRS and the larger system of which the product is an element.
% A block diagram showing the major elements of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces
% can be helpful.
% Describe how the software operates within the following constraints:
% a) System interfaces;
% b) User interfaces;
% c) Hardware interfaces;
% d) Software interfaces;
\subsubsection{Product perspective}
The system will consist of a studied and selected application where one of its sections or just a instruction
is replaced for a approximated version to improve execution time, area, and power consumption while
keeping an acceptable error threshold.

Besides specific contrains of the selected application itself, the desired error threshold will be the only constrain of the system. 

The system will have operate with ---- while respecting their own contrains like ....

% Provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an
% accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and
% invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
% Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section of the
% higher-level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software product.
% Note that for the sake of clarity
% a) The product functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the
% acquirer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.
% b) Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships. Such a
% diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among
% variables.
\subsubsection{Product functions}
With the research on ASIPs, the approximate computing paradigm will be able to expand, this will 
enable more personalized applications so the right price in area, power consumption or execution time
is paid for an allowed error level.


The ASIPs that will be integrated to an specific application will have the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Adjustable error threshold:
 
 \item Adjustable resource consumption:
 
 \item Scalable:
\end{itemize}



% Describe those general characteristics of the intended groups of users of the product including characteristics
% that may influence usability, such as educational level, experience, disabilities, and technical expertise. This
% description should not state specific requirements, but rather should state the reasons why certain specific
% requirements are later specified in specific requirements in subclause 9.5.9.
\subsubsection{User characteristics}
Since approximated computing is still in its infancy, a lot of research and testing is still needed, 
so the users of the developed ASIPs are the same research groups of which this 
project is a part of. The research group members posses, in general, these characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Technical knowledge:
 
 \item Access to specialized tools:
\end{itemize}



% Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the supplier's options, including
% a) Regulatory policies;
% b) Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
% c) Interfaces to other applications;
% d) Parallel operation;
% e) Audit functions;
% f) Control functions;
% g) Higher-order language requirements;
% h) Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
% i) Quality requirements (e.g., reliability)
% j) Criticality of the application;
% k) Safety and security considerations.
% l) Physical/mental considerations
\subsubsection{Limitations}
The following limitations are considered for the ASIPs developed:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Performance gain:
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Requirements}



% Define all inputs into and outputs from the software system. The description should complement the interface
% descriptions in 9.5.3.3.1 through 9.5.3.3.5, and should not repeat information there.
% Each interface defined should include the following content:
% a) Name of item;
% b) Description of purpose;
% c) Source of input or destination of output;
% d) Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance;
% e) Units of measure;
% f) Timing;
% g) Relationships to other inputs/outputs;
% h) Screen formats/organization;
% i) Window formats/organization;
% j) Data formats;
% k) Command formats;
% l) Endmessages.
\subsection{External interfaces}




% Define the fundamental actions that have to take place in the software in accepting and processing the inputs
% and in processing and generating the outputs, including
% a) Validity checks on the inputs
% b) Exact sequence of operations
% c) Responses to abnormal situations, including
%   1) Overflow
%   2) Communication facilities
%   3) Error handling and recovery
% d) Effect of parameters
% e) Relationship of outputs to inputs, including
%   1) Input/output sequences
%   2) Formulas for input to output conversion
% It may be appropriate to partition the functional requirements into subfunctions or subprocesses. This does
% not imply that the software design will also be partitioned that way.
\subsection{Functions}



% Define usability (quality in use) requirements. Usability requirements and objectives for the software system
% include measurable effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction criteria in specific contexts of use.
\subsection{Usability requirements}



% Specify both the static and the dynamic numerical requirements placed on the software or on human
% interaction with the software as a whole.
% Static numerical requirements may include the following:
% a) The number of terminals to be supported;
% b) The number of simultaneous users to be supported;
% c) Amount and type of information to be handled.
% Static numerical requirements are sometimes identified under a separate section entitled Capacity.
% Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for example, the numbers of transactions and tasks and the
% amount of data to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions.
% The performance requirements should be stated in measurable terms.
% For example,
% 95 % of the transactions shall be processed in less than 1 second.
% rather than,
% An operator shall not have to wait for the transaction to complete.
\subsection{Performance requirements}



%Specify the logical requirements for any information that is to be placed into a database, including:
% a) Types of information used by various functions;
% b) Frequency of use;
% c) Accessing capabilities;
% d) Data entities and their relationships;
% e) Integrity constraints;
% f) Data retention requirements.
\subsection{Logical database requirements}



% Specify constraints on the system design imposed by external standards, regulatory requirements, or project
% limitations.
\subsection{Design constraints}


% Specify the required attributes of the software product. The following is a partial list of examples:
% a) Reliability - Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time
% of delivery.
% b) Availability - Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system
% such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.
% c) Security - Specify the requirements to protect the software from accidental or malicious access, use
% modification, destruction, or disclosure. Specific requirements in this area could include the need to:
%   1) Utilize certain cryptographic techniques;
%   2) Keep specific log or history data sets;
%   3) Assign certain functions to different modules;
%   4) Restrict communications between some areas of the program;
%   5) Check data integrity for critical variables;
%   6) Assure data privacy.
% d) Maintainability - Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of maintenance of the software itself.
% These may include requirements for certain modularity, interfaces, or complexity limitation. Requirements
% should not be placed here just because they are thought to be good design practices.
% e) Portability - Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of porting the software to other host
% machines and/or operating systems, including:
%   1) Percentage of elements with host-dependent code;
%   2) Percentage of code that is host dependent;
%   3) Use of a proven portable language;
%   4) Use of a particular compiler or language subset;
%   5) Use of a particular operating system.
\subsection{Software system attributes}


% The SRS should contain additional supporting information including
% a) Sample input/output formats, descriptions of cost analysis studies, or results of user surveys;
% b) Supporting or background information that can help the readers of the SRS;
% c) A description of the problems to be solved by the software;
% d) Special packaging instructions for the code and the media to meet security, export, initial loading, or other
% requirements.
% The SRS should explicitly state whether or not these information items are to be considered part of the
% requirements.

\section{Appendices}


% List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design
% constraints on the software but any changes to these factors can affect the requirements in the SRS. For
% example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated
% for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change
% accordingly.
